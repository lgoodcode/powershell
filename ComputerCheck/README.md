# About

This script uses the Active Directory module to allow admins to query a building, room, or a 
specific computer to determine if the computer(s) are online and if so, if there is a user
currently logged in either locally or remotely. 

## Shortcut

A shortcut can be created to directly run the script in its own window and close when done.

To do that, create a shortcut with the following target:

`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File PATH_TO_FILE`
